**Learn WebAssembly C++ programming by building a retro space game**

## What is this book about?
Within the next few years, WebAssembly will change the web as we know it. It promises a world where you can write an application for the web in any language, and compile it for native platforms as well as the web.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Build web applications with near-native performance using WebAssembly
* Become familiar with how web applications can be used to create games using HTML5 Canvas, WebGL, and SDL
* Become well versed with game development concepts such as sprites, animation, particle systems, AI, physics, camera design, sound  effects, and shaders
* Deploy C/C++ applications to the browser using WebAssembly and Emscripten
* Understand how Emscripten HTML shell templates, JavaScript glue code, and a WebAssembly module interact
